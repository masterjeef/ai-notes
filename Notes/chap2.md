### Levels of Measurement

In statistics, data is broken down into two major categories: qualitative and quantitative.

* quantitative data deals with numbers
* qualitative data deals with qualities, or descriptions

Example: **A cup of coffee**

* Qualitative Data
    * Brown
    * Strong aroma
* Quantitative Data
    * 106 calories
    * $4.99 cost

 Data can be categorized further into the following 4 categories:
 1. Nominal data
 2. Ordinal data
 3. Interval data
 4. Ration data

It's easiest to determine them based off of what mathematical operations can be applied, for example :

|         | Nominal | Ordinal       | Interval | Ratio |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------|-------|
| * or /  | No      | No            | No       | Yes   |
| + or -  | No      | No            | Yes      | Yes   |
| < or >  | No      | Yes           | Yes      | Yes   |
| = or != | Yes     | Yes           | Yes      | Yes   |
| Example | Gender  | Hot/warm/cold | Year     | Age   |
